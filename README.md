Optionally, you can also use the login button in the popup to highlight & list

- Answers hidden due to pagination of multiple answers
- Comments hidden under "show more comments"

## Instructions

In order to see this plugin in action, open any StackOverflow question where you have posted at least one answer. Note that you need to be logged in to StackOverflow.com in your browser.

> Disclaimer: this plugin doesn't store/share your user information in any means. the logged in user is identified using the StackOverflow navigation bar or **optionally** by using the "login" button from popup (discussed below).

Once the question is opened in StackOverflow, you'll notice that the answer/s posted by you will be highlighted with a "green" border and they will be automatically brought to the top of the answers list.

Check out the [screenshot](./Assets/Screenshots/Highlight_Sort%20answers.png) for a [question][3] where I have posted an answer.\
Even though the StackOverflow sort is set to "Highest score" & it has another answer with a score of 5, my answer is listed at the top and highlighted with green border.
