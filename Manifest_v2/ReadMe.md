# Manifest V2

The code in this folder follows [Manifest Version 2][1] standards. 

Manifest version 2 is no longer being maintained
> As of January 17, 2022 Chrome Web Store has stopped accepting new Manifest V2 extensions. We strongly recommend that new extensions target Manifest V3.

This is used to create the [plugin for Firefox][2] since it currently [doesn't support Manifest version 3][3].
